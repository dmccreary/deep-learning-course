## p5.js 2.x Upgrade: MicroSim Fixes Needed (2026-09-05)

A static scan of this repo's `docs/sims/` MicroSims found **1 sim(s)** using p5.js v1-only APIs that will break if upgraded to p5.js 2.x (the microsim-generator skill's templates now default to p5@2.3.2). Fix these before bumping this repo's MicroSims past p5@1.x.

- [ ] **chicken-road** (`docs/sims/chicken-road/`)
    - `chicken-road.js` uses `quadraticVertex(...)`, folded into `bezierVertex()` in v2 — replace with `bezierOrder(2)` followed by single-control-point `bezierVertex()` calls.
