    Prompt Name: Wordcloud

    Create a list of the 50 most important Concepts in the
    deep learning course.  Use the concept dependency
    information to find the concepts that have the most
    other concepts depend upon.
    Cross check this with what you believe are the most
    important concepts to learn in a deep learning course.
    For each concept give it a score of between 40 and 70
    for how important the concept is relative to the other
    concepts in the course.  The more important concepts
    should have a higher score.

    Then use the JavaScript wordcloud-2 library to generate
    the wordcloud for this list of 50 concepts.  
    For each concept, allow the user to click on the link and 
    have the link go to the ../../glossary.md#[ConceptLabel] link.
