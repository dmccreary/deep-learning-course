# Concept Taxonomy

!!! prompt
    Given the list of concepts, your next task is to
    organize these concepts into a taxonomy by grouping them into
    appropriate categories. Each category should include concepts
    that share similar characteristics, functions, or applications.

    Suggest 10-12 categories for the taxonomy and assign each concept
    to one or more categories. Ensure that the categories cover
    a range of concept types, including abstract ideas, practical
    applications, Python libraries, common misunderstandings, and real-world examples.

    Avoid redundancy and ensure that each category is distinct.

    Your first category is "Foundational Concepts", your second is "Terms and Definitions".   A final category might be "Goals".

## Workflow

ChatGPT o1 thought about course taxonomy and categories for 3m 36s

**Crafting a taxonomy**

I'm organizing 200 concepts into 10-12 categories, including foundational concepts, terms and definitions, and goals. Ensuring a variety of concept types without redundancy.

**Shaping the categories**

I'm organizing the taxonomy with 10-12 categories, focusing on topics like foundational concepts, key tools, data engineering, core ML, model architectures, optimization, advanced topics, and real-world examples.

**Clarifying "Goals"**

Hmm, I'm thinking about whether "Goals" means measuring success, project scoping, or responsible AI like interpretability. Each concept will fit into one of the 10 categories.

**Shaping the framework**

I'm honing in on Python tools, data engineering, Neural Network Architectures, Reinforcement Learning, and integration with interpretation, ethics, fairness, MLOps, and project workflow.

**Mapping the categories**

I'm working through merging "Interpretation, Ethics, & Fairness" with "Goals," but it seems intricate and possibly ineffective. It's interesting to see these elements might be better handled separately.

**Refining the taxonomy**

I'm merging "Sequence & Natural Language" with "Advanced & Specialized Topics," and integrating "Reinforcement Learning" into the revised category. This results in a sleeker, more coherent framework.

**Finalizing the categories**

I'm looking at a streamlined taxonomy with 11 categories, including Foundational Concepts, Python Tools, Data Engineering, Advanced Topics, and Real-World Applications. Assigning concepts to these categories now.

**Voucher assignment**

Deciding whether to include "Nobel Prizes" in "Foundational Concepts" or "History of AI" is tricky. I'll weigh the typical context for each category to make a balanced decision.

**Piecing together the foundation**

I'm carefully grouping concepts like AI and ML definitions, AI history, Nobel Prizes, key figures, AI branches, and neural networks into foundational concepts.

**Mapping out key concepts**

I'm digging into foundational concepts like AI and ML definitions, AI history, Nobel Prizes, key figures, AI branches, and neural network origins, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive approach.

**Clarifying definitions**

I'm thinking through terms for "Terms and Definitions," focusing on clear, concise definitions like Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning, Regression vs. Classification, and evaluation metrics.

**Mapping concepts**

Pulling together Python tools, data engineering, neural network architectures, and advanced topics like transformers and generative models. Assigning terms systematically to refine clarity and avoid redundancy.

**Refining category alignment**

Consider placing "Attention Mechanism" under "Neural Network Architectures." "Reinforcement Learning" and "Advanced Recognition Techniques" seem to fit well inside "Advanced & Specialized Topics."

**Merging concepts**

I'm contemplating combining "Reinforcement Learning" with "Advanced & Specialized Topics," and "Project Scoping" seems to fit better in "MLOps & Project Workflow" or as "Goals."

**Mapping real applications**

I'm organizing concepts on ethical AI, MLOps, and project workflow, including resource allocation, version control, and agile methods. Next up: integrating "Project Scoping" and refining "Goals."

**Clarifying project metrics**

I'm thinking about including "Evaluation Metrics" and "Project Scoping" under "Goals," refining their roles to ensure they align cohesively within the broader context.

**Integrating distinct elements**

I'm honing the "Goals" category with evaluation metrics, precision, recall, and other metrics. For dimensionality reduction and data visualization tools, they seem to fit better in "Data Preparation & Engineering" or "Training & Optimization."

**Mapping concepts**

I'm integrating dimensionality reduction and data visualization tools into "Data Preparation & Engineering," and placing "Prompt Engineering" in "Advanced & Specialized Topics" or "Sequence & Natural Language."

**Mapping as I go**

Integrating concepts like "Prompt Engineering" into "Advanced & Specialized Topics" and aligning "Attention Mechanism" with "Neural Network Architectures." Also, I'm finalizing the assignment of various ML and data concepts.

**Mapping out assignments**

There's a clear progression: integrating "Data Ethics" into "Interpretation, Ethics, & Fairness," placing "ImageNet" in "Neural Network Architectures," and categorizing "Text Generation" with "Advanced & Specialized Topics."

**Organizing concepts**

I'm grouping "Language Modeling" and "Text Generation" into "Advanced & Specialized Topics," and aligning "Attention Mechanism" with "Neural Network Architectures". Robotics fits best in "Real-World Applications."

**Organizing and refining**

Assigning concepts like "Loss Surface" and "Data Annotation" to "Training & Optimization" and "Data Prep & MLOps" respectively. "Robotics" fits well in "Real-World Applications."

**Finalizing concepts**

I'm wrapping up by mapping "ChatGPT Concept" and "Adversarial Examples" to "Advanced & Specialized Topics" and "Interpretation, Ethics, & Fairness," ensuring each concept is logically categorized.

**Finalizing mappings**

Assigning concepts like "Quantization," "Pruning," and "Edge Deployment" to "Advanced & Specialized Topics," and ensuring all concepts fit logically within the intended categories.

**Finalizing concepts**

I'm completing the mapping of advanced concepts like "DQN," "Actor-Critic," and "Reward Shaping" to "Advanced & Specialized Topics," and ensuring all terms are logically categorized.

**Piecing together assignments**

I'm ensuring "SciPy" fits into "Python Tools," aligning "Precision," "Recall," "F1," and "AUC-ROC" with "Goals," and placing "Data Splits" and "Data Visualization Tools" under "Data Prep & Engineering."

**Aligning the framework**

Aligning "GPU Acceleration" and "TPU Acceleration" with "Advanced & Specialized Topics," "Project Scoping" and "Version Control Workflow" with "MLOps & Project Workflow."

**Refining concept categories**

I'm evolving "Adam Optimizer" and "Hyperparameter Tuning" within "Training & Optimization." "Data Visualization" and "PCA" fit snugly under "Data Prep & Engineering."

**Finalizing taxonomy**

OK, let me see. I'm ensuring each concept lands in the right category, refining concepts like "Weight Decay" and "Evaluation Metrics." I'm setting a clear, concise list of 11 categories.

**Mapping out preferences**

I'm factoring in the need for brevity and the user's desire for a range of concept types. Considering a summarized 11-category list with multi-category assignments, focusing on practical applications and Python libraries.

## Result

Below is an **example taxonomy** of the 200 concepts, grouped into **11 distinct categories**. Each concept may appear in more than one category if it makes sense pedagogically (e.g., a concept can be both a "term/definition" and also relevant to "training & optimization").

In practice, you might refine these groupings further or redistribute concepts according to your specific course design. The primary goals are (1) to ensure that each concept is accounted for at least once, (2) to keep categories mutually distinct, and (3) to cover a wide range of types (abstract ideas, practical tools, potential pitfalls, real-world use cases, etc.).

### Notes on Overlaps

-   Some items (e.g., "Overfitting Vs Underfitting") appear in both **Terms and Definitions** and **Training & Optimization**, because they are foundational distinctions *and* deeply tied to optimization.
-   "Object Detection," "Data Ethics," "Data Acquisition," and several others also appear in more than one category when relevant.

This multi-category approach reflects the reality that many deep learning concepts straddle theoretical and practical lines and can belong in more than one "bucket." Depending on your course or textbook structure, you may wish to split them differently or provide cross-references.
