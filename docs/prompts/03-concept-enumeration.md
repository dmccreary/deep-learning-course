# Concept Enumeration

!!! prompt
    Please generate a list of the 200 core concepts that
    need to be covered in this course and the order in
    which they should be taught.

    Return numbered list of these core concepts using
    a single line per concept.  For each concept,
    just return a short concept name and use acronyms or abbreviations
    when appropriate.  They will be used as labels in a graph network.
    Make sure that the concepts are distinct not duplicated in the list.

    Use title case for the concept names.

    Start with the most basic foundational concepts and then
    proceed to the most complex concepts.

## Workflow

**Setting the stage**

I'm compiling a list of 200 unique core concepts for a deep learning course. The order will start with basic concepts and gradually advance to more complex ones.

**Expanding the list**

I'm building upon the course outline to include topics like generative AI and RL, ensuring each is distinct and enumerated correctly while avoiding duplicates.

**Organizing topics**

Structuring the course into categories like basic foundations, Python tools, and advanced topics such as generative AI and domain-specific architectures to ensure a systematic progression.

**Finalizing concepts**

Wrapping up the course with distinctions like "AI Definition" and "ML Definition," ensuring clarity with concise, title-case concepts in 200 carefully enumerated lines.

**Ensuring clarity**

I'm refining concepts like "AI Definition" and "ML Definition," combining title case and potentially using acronyms for distinct clarity. The goal is to maintain precision and avoid redundancy.

**Detailed line distribution**

I'm assigning 10-line chunks to various topics, such as Python, ML fundamentals, neural networks, and advanced architectures, ensuring comprehensive coverage across all 200 lines.

**Progressing through topics**

I'm charting our course with concise lines to cover "NN Fundamentals" and "Training Processes," ensuring distinct and systematic progression across 200 meticulously controlled entries.

**Venturing into complexity**

I'm exploring advanced topics in neural networks, including special architectures like Capsule Networks and Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes, as well as Transformer techniques for natural language processing.

**Unraveling generative AI**

I'm analyzing advanced generative models and reinforcement learning techniques. This involves delving into diffusion models, denoising diffusion, principal components, and ethical considerations like fairness and privacy.

**Mapping deployment and application**

I'm covering GPU and TPU acceleration, memory management, model compression, and practical applications like computer vision and autonomous driving. This completes the cycle, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
