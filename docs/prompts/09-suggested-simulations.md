# Interactive Simulation Concepts for Deep Learning Education

!!! prompt
    Our textbook development team would like to use generative AI to create simulations for explaining concepts that are difficult to understand.
    Of all of the concepts in this course, which concepts might benefit
    from an interactive simulation?  We are using tools like p5.js to
    build the simulations.  They are interactive and allow students to 
    move range control sliders to change the drawing parameters or
    simulation parameters.  For example to explain what "parameter count"
    is in a model we allow the students to change the number of layers in
    a neural network, and the number of neurons in a layer.

    Please list the concepts that can be explained by a simulation.
    Describe the simulation in detail and suggest what parameters
    the student might change.
