# Generating Deep Learning Equations

!!! prompt
    Create a list of the 100 most commonly used
    equations in a college level course in deep learning.

    For each equation, return the following:

    1. The name of the equation in markdown level 4.
    2. Within the body, return the equation in LaTeX format
    3. Surround the equation with dollar signs
    4. For each variable in the equation, add a "where:" that defines each variable
    5. Put blank lines around the list of variables
    6. Wrap the variables names in dollar signs

    Examples:

    #### Slope and Intercept
    $y = m * x + b$

    where:

    - $y$ is the vertical axis
    - $x$ is the horizontal axis
    - $m$ is the slope
    - $b$ is the intercept

    #### Area of a Circle
    $A = 2\pi r^2$
    where:

    - $A$ is the area of the circle
    - $r$ is the radius
