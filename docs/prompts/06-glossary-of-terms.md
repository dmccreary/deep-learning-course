# Generating a Glossary 

!!! prompt
    Next we need a glossary of terms.  
    
    For each of the 250 concepts, please create a ISO 11179 metadata registry type definition that is:
    
    1. precise
    2. concise
    3. distinct
    4. non-circular

    Do not place any specific business rules in the definition.
    
    When appropriate, give an example of how this term is used in the course.  Return each concept label in Markdown level four "####" and the definition for the term in the body text.  Use **Example:** before the example, but do not put a newline after the colon.

    Return the entire glossary of terms in a single markdown file.
    
    Place
    "# Glossary of Terms" at the top of the file.  
    
    Return the terms in alphabetical order.
