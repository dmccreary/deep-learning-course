## AlexNet

This graphic novel sequence tells the origin story of deep learning's revolution, beginning with "The Toronto Trio"—Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton—facing the monumental challenge of neural networks. In "The GPU Awakening," they harness the power of gaming GPUs to accelerate training. "The Training Vigil" captures their relentless effort, leading to "The Revealing," where AlexNet stuns the world with a groundbreaking 15.3% error rate. "The Revolution Begins" shows the global ripple effect as labs adopt deep learning and AI breakthroughs multiply. The story concludes with "The Neural Future," a hopeful epilogue depicting modern AI applications branching out from the glowing seed of AlexNet.
